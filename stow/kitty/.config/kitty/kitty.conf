tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0
tab_bar_style powerline
#: The tab bar style, can be one of:
#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color (see tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator (see tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators (see tab_powerline_style)
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/#select-tab action which presents you with a list
#:     of tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_min_tabs 2
tab_switch_strategy previous
tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1
tab_separator " â”‡"
#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

tab_powerline_style angled
#: can be one of: angled, slanted, or round.

tab_activity_symbol none
tab_title_template "{index}:{title}"
#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title. If you wish to include the tab-index as well, use something
#: like: {index}: {title}. Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for
#: goto_tab N. If you prefer to see the index as a superscript, use
#: {sup.index}. In addition you can use {layout_name} for the current
#: layout name, {num_windows} for the number of windows in the tab and
#: {num_window_groups} for the number of window groups (not counting
#: overlay windows) in the tab. Note that formatting is done by
#: Python's string formatting machinery, so you can use, for instance,
#: {layout_name[:2].upper()} to show only the first two letters of the
#: layout name, upper-cased. If you want to style the text, you can
#: use styling directives, for example:
#: {fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.default}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}green
#: bg{fmt.bg.normal}. Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: {fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}.

active_tab_title_template none
#: Template to use for active tabs, if not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.
tab_bar_background none

# Sending arbitrary text on shortcut key presses
# You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to
# the client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example:
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text
# This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+a key combination.
# The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use escapes like
# \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can
# just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument
# to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
# values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.
# The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
# the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty
# extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor
# to the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key):
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
# }}}

#: Advanced {{{

shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files.

editor .

#: The terminal editor (such as ``vim`` or ``nano``) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell (``$SHELL -l -i -c env``) to see if your
#: shell config files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (``vim``, ``emacs``,
#: etc) and take the first one that exists on your system.

close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the
#: default), the terminal will remain open when the child exits as
#: long as there are still processes outputting to the terminal (for
#: example disowned or backgrounded processes). If yes, the window
#: will close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it
#: to yes means that any background processes still using the terminal
#: can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc.  Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections. You can chose to either allow any program running
#: within kitty to control it, with yes or only programs that connect
#: to the socket specified with the kitty --listen-on command line
#: option, if you use the value socket-only. The latter is useful if
#: you want to prevent programs running on a remote computer over ssh
#: from controlling kitty. Reloading the config will not affect this
#: setting.

listen_on none

#: Tell kitty to listen to the specified unix/tcp socket for remote
#: control connections. Note that this will apply to all kitty
#: instances. It can be overridden by the kitty --listen-on command
#: line flag. This option accepts only UNIX sockets, such as
#: unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or (on Linux) unix:@mykitty. Environment
#: variables are expanded. If {kitty_pid} is present then it is
#: replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the PID of the
#: kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen. This option
#: is ignored unless you also set allow_remote_control to enable
#: remote control. See the help for kitty --listen-on for more
#: details. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# env 

#: Specify environment variables to set in all child processes. Note
#: that environment variables are expanded recursively, so if you
#: use::

#:     env MYVAR1=a
#:     env MYVAR2=${MYVAR1}/${HOME}/b

#: The value of MYVAR2 will be a/<path to home directory>/b.

# update_check_interval 24

#: Periodically check if an update to kitty is available. If an update
#: is found a system notification is displayed informing you of the
#: available update. The default is to check every 24 hrs, set to zero
#: to disable. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#startup-sessions in the
#: kitty documentation for details. Note that relative paths are
#: interpreted with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment
#: variables in the path are expanded. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
#: primary read-primary. The default is to allow writing to the
#: clipboard and primary selection. Note that enabling the read
#: functionality is a security risk as it means that any program, even
#: one running on a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See
#: also  clipboard_max_size.

clipboard_max_size 64

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_control. A value of zero means no size limit is applied.

allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink (OSC 8) escape sequences. If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click by holding down ctrl+shift and clicking
#: with the mouse. The special value of ``ask`` means that kitty will
#: ask before opening the link.

term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.
